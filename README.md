# Analyzing Risk Within Movie Genres


## Packages 

```python 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd 
import seaborn as sns
```

### Goals

- Use existing data from [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)and [TMBD](https://www.kaggle.com/juzershakir/tmdb-movies-dataset)to determine if there is a difference in risk between genres
- **Risk** is defined as the standard deviation divided by the mean
